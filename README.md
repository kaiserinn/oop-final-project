# Final Project for OOP Subject
This repository is currently empty as I have not yet decided on a project for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) subject final project. 

## What is this repository for?
This repository contains the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) subject, created by Azhar, Raihan, Abellia, and Aqilah. The project's name is yet to be determined, but it will be based on a research paper related to OOP. The project will be implemented using the Java programming language and follow the principles of the OOP paradigm.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the project, including the project proposal, progress reports, and the final report. You can clone this repository using Git and run the project on your local machine to explore its functionalities and features. We welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have, as we continue to improve the project and enhance its features.

As soon as I have an idea for a project, I will update this repository and include all relevant information such as project description, goals, features, and usage instructions.

Thank you for your interest, and please check back soon for updates!
